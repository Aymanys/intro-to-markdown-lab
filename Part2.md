# How to make a cheesburger sandwich

## Ingredients:

- 1 beef patty (or plant-based patty)
- 2 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or your choice)
- 2 burger buns
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Onion slices (optional)
- Ketchup
- Mustard
- Mayonnaise (optional)
- Salt and pepper
- Cooking oil or butter
- Instructions:
- Prepare the Beef Patty

**Step 1**
Season the beef patty with salt and pepper on both sides.
Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat and add a little oil or butter.

\*Step 2\*\*
Cook the patty for about 3-4 minutes on each side until it's browned and cooked to your preferred doneness. For medium, the internal temperature should reach 160°F (71°C).

**Step 3**
When the patty is almost done, place a slice of cheese on top and allow it to melt (cover the skillet for about a minute to help the cheese melt faster).
Toast the Buns

**Step 4**
While the patty is cooking, slice the burger buns in half and lightly toast them in the skillet or on a toaster until they’re golden brown.

**Step 5**
Spread ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise (optional) on the bottom half of the bun.
Add lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and onion slices.
Place the cheeseburger patty on top of the vegetables.
Add the top half of the bun.
Serve
